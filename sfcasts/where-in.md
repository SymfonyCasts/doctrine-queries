# WHERE IN ()

Coming soon...

We have categories for pets and love, but if we search up here for pets love Nothing is found. Makes sense. We're searching to see if this string is matching the name or or the icon key So let's complicate our search a bit more to see if we can match both those categories I'm actually searching word by word here All right, so the query for this is over in repository category repository search here we go So term is the string we typed in so check this out. Let's actually use say term list equals explode And I'll put a space and then I'll say term so if you want a really rich search You should actually use a real search provider We can do some pretty good stuff here to get a nice search going just using our database So this is now going to be an array of all of the words inside the search term What I want to do is a where in so I'm gonna say and where Where category net that name is in one of these terms so that if the category name is love and love is one of these terms it will match And we can totally do that. So we have category name like a search term. So right here. I'm going to add or category dot name In and The trickiest thing about this is just the syntax So you want to do parentheses there? So normally you would do something like if you're writing a raw SQL query You would do something like that So in this case, of course, we're not gonna just put the string inside the query. We're gonna create a new parameter here How about colon term list? Okay Then down here we need to pass it in. So let's say set parameter term list term list term list So the key thing here is that when you use the end you're going to need the parentheses like normal But what you're actually passing as the parameter is an array. It's not a Comma separated list you don't need to do that just passing the array doctor is going to figure it out and now It's just that easy All right.  Next you're probably familiar with The rand function For mysql or maybe the year function or one of the many mysql or postgres functions that there are Well, you might be surprised to learn that some of those won't work.
